# Coders Surf School

This is a website for a new idea for a summer camp ; a mixture of coding and surfing . 
Users of this website will be able to ger an overview of what the camp is about. 
Parents will then be able to view the members of staff. 
They will then be able to submit a form for signup.

### Choice of font

I went for a font that conveyed a sense of fun and play, and something that would make people think of a beach setting.
Eventually I settled on two fonts to keep things simple, a font for the larger headings, and a smaller , more simpler font for everything else. 
The larger font was called Lobster, and the smaller font was called Roboto. 
Both of which were found on Google fonts, and it was simple to add them into the code of my css via a link provided by Google.

### Choice of colours

I wanted to make the page look vibrant and "beachy" , so no drab colors, this had to look bold and to stand out with a contrast of cold colors that would convey a sense of the water, and other warmer colours that would remind the user of the sun. Together they help conjur an image of the beach in a users mind, and offer a sense of vibrancy and convey the idea that this is about fun! 

I chose four colours to make up the color pallette.

    -#007965
    -#B05A7A
    -#F58634
    -#FFCC29

Here is what they look like:

## Features

### Sticky Navbar

The style of Navbar that I have chosen is a sticky navbar. I have chosen this , because in the first section of the website, the homepage (index.html) is rather long at lower screen sizes, and I did not want the user to have to scroll all the way to the top if they wanted to navigate to another section of the website.

Example of the sticky navbar:
