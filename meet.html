                    Donald might look young, but he has more than 15 years of coding experience under his belt.
                    He built his own surfing robot when he was only twelve years old, and even got a grant from
                    Boston Dynamics to do further research and development on surfing robotics. A code instructor and 
                    surf instructor combined.

                <p>
                    Gandalf is something of a legend in the surfing community, as he goes way back to the 
                    early days of surfing. He actually taught the Beach Boys how to surf, and he was humming 
                    a little tune to himself during his lessons with them. That little tune went on to be the 
                    inspiration for "Surfing the USA".

                    Sally is one of the finest surf instructors that the world has ever seen.
