                        It might seem odd to pair a very kinetic and physically demanding sport with something like coding, but research has shown that after vigorus
                        exercise coupled with the calmness and piece of mind that being out in the ocean can provide, children are much more able to focus and to comprehend
                        what our expert coding tutors have to say.

                       Nutrition is very important to us at Coders Surf School, no less so than when when the child is at home. 
                       We consult with each parent on opening day, to talk about your childs nutritional needs while at camp. 
                       and through simple consultation, tailor make a meal plan for your child.
